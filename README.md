# Montage
An audio desktop application written in C++ using the [JUCE](https://juce.com/) framework for creating music using the compositional technique [Micromontage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_collage#Micromontage). The application is inspired by IRIN, created by Carlos Caires and the work of [Horacio Vaggione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horacio_Vaggione).

The project is still in its infancy and is not functional. Further details will be added here in due course.
